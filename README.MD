- **Event Date:** December 2022
- **Organizers:**  [Data & Web Science Laboratory](https://datalab.csd.auth.gr/) at [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.csd.auth.gr/) (AUTH) and [RAINBOW](https://rainbow-h2020.eu/)

## Highlights:

- **Participants:** Sixteen individuals formed five teams to tackle a challenging IoT technology problem.

- **Learning:** We were introduced to IoT concepts, RAINBOW's Fog Computing platform, and Docker technology.

- **Task:** Our objective was to create IoT applications to optimize energy data management within a fog network.

- **Execution:** Teams personally coded their solutions, crafted Docker images, and deployed them onto virtual machines acting as fog nodes and cloud servers.

- **Challenges:** We focused on minimizing data exchanges with cloud services while effectively utilizing fog resources.

- **Rewards:** The winning team received a Raspberry Pi 400 kit, while all participants were gifted a Raspberry Pi Pico W.

- **Obstacles:** Despite the praise for RAINBOW's utility, some participants faced time constraints and initial connectivity issues, which were mitigated with support from experienced researchers.

## Achievements:

- **1st Place:** My team secured the 1st place in the hackathon.
- **Knowledge Enhancement:** Through this experience, we significantly expanded our expertise in Docker technology and IoT concepts, furthering our contribution to the IoT development community.
